function [v] = sailaksh_hw1_p4(f,x)
%sailaksh_hw1_p4 Fuction that returns the evaluation of f at x as v.
%  Uses function handle f, evaluates at x and returns it to v.
%  f = anonymous function
%  x = scalar input
%  v = output varibale
    
    v = f(x); % The anonymous function f is evaluated at scalar x and stored in v
